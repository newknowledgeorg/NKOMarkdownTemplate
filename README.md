This package provides R Markdown templates for researchers at Knology (formerly New Knowledge Organization = NKO).

Templates include R Markdown documents that render toâ€¦

  - MS Word Document with Knology Themes

We saved the package to a public repository to simplify installation for
the Knology team and to promote transparency with our funders and partners.

To install, copy/paste the following into the R console:

> `devtools::install_github("newknowledgeorg/NKOMarkdownTemplate")`

We welcome comments and suggestions from other researchers.
