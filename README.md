README for NKO R Markdown Template
================

This package provides an R Markdown template for researchers at New Knowledge Organization (NKO).

We saved the package to a public repository to simplify installation for the NKO team and to promote transparency with our funders and partners.

To install run:

> <code>devtools::install\_github("newknowledgeorg/NKOMarkdownTemplate")</code>

We welcome comments and suggestions from other researchers.
