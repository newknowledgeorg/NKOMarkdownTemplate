This package provides R Markdown templates for researchers at New Knowledge Organization (NKO).

Templates include R Markdown documents that render to...

* MS Word Document with NKO Themes
* MS Powerpoint Document with NKO Themes

We saved the package to a public repository to simplify installation for the NKO team and to promote transparency with our funders and partners.

To install, copy/paste the following into the R console:

> `devtools::install_github("newknowledgeorg/NKOMarkdownTemplate")`

OR

> `devtools::install_local("~/Dropbox (Knology)/NKO Core/Admin/Professional Development/R Training/NKOMarkdownTemplate/")`

We welcome comments and suggestions from other researchers.
